## 2. Algorithm Performance Impact Analysis

### 2.1 Kalman Filter Adaptations Required

**Standard Human Kalman Parameters:**
```
Process noise (Q): 0.1-0.5
Measurement noise (R): 1-5
Prediction interval: 1-2 seconds
```

**Pet-Adapted Kalman Parameters:**

**Small Pets:**
```
Process noise (Q): 2-8 (4-16x increase due to erratic movement)
Measurement noise (R): 0.5-2 (reduced due to consistent body mass)
Prediction interval: 0.2-0.5 seconds (4-10x faster updates needed)
Motion model: Constant acceleration with jerk compensation
```

**Medium/Large Pets:**
```
Process noise (Q): 1.5-5 (3-10x increase)
Measurement noise (R): 0.8-3
Prediction interval: 0.3-0.8 seconds
Motion model: Variable acceleration with momentum tracking
```

### 2.2 Trilateration Accuracy Impact

**Expected Accuracy Degradation:**

| Pet Size | Static Accuracy | Walking | Running | Sprint |
|----------|----------------|---------|---------|---------|
| Small | 0.3-0.8m | 0.8-1.5m | 1.5-3.0m | 3.0-6.0m |
| Medium | 0.2-0.6m | 0.6-1.2m | 1.2-2.5m | 2.5-4.5m |
| Large | 0.2-0.5m | 0.5-1.0m | 1.0-2.0m | 2.0-3.5m |

**Contributing Factors:**
- Signal reflection changes due to rapid height variations
- Multipath interference from ground-level movement
- Increased measurement uncertainty at high velocities

### 2.3 Particle Filter Requirements

**Enhanced Particle Count Requirements:**

- Reason: Multi-modal behavior states (rest/active/play/hide)

**Behavioral State Estimation:**

```python
# Proposed pet behavior states
BEHAVIOR_STATES = {
    'REST': {
        'velocity_range': (0, 0.2),      # m/s
        'acceleration_range': (0, 0.5),   # m/s²
        'duration_typical': 1800-7200,    # seconds
        'transition_probability': 0.05
    },
    'EXPLORE': {
        'velocity_range': (0.5, 2.0),
        'acceleration_range': (0.5, 5.0),
        'duration_typical': 120-600,
        'transition_probability': 0.3
    },
    'PLAY': {
        'velocity_range': (1.0, 8.0),
        'acceleration_range': (2.0, 15.0),
        'duration_typical': 30-300,
        'transition_probability': 0.4
    },
    'SPRINT': {
        'velocity_range': (5.0, 20.0),
        'acceleration_range': (8.0, 25.0),
        'duration_typical': 10-120,
        'transition_probability': 0.6
    }
}
```

    def __init__(self, pet_size='medium'):
        self.gait_phases = ['stance', 'swing', 'flight', 'landing']
        self.stride_frequency = self._get_stride_freq(pet_size)
        self.acceleration_profile = self._get_accel_profile(pet_size)
    
    def predict_next_position(self, current_state, behavior_state):
        # Gait-aware prediction with behavior modulation
        base_prediction = self._kinematic_predict(current_state)
        behavior_adjustment = self._behavior_adjust(behavior_state)
        return base_prediction * behavior_adjustment
```
