# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Creating the WhoFi Repository

### 1. Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd /workspaces/scratchpad/whofi
git init
git add .
git commit -m "📡 Initial WhoFi research repository with comprehensive findings

- 📡 Hardware guides: ESP32, antennas, and deployment strategies
- 🏗️ Complete system architectures for various use cases

🚀 Ready for community contributions and real-world implementations"
```

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI (if available)
gh repo create jedarden/whofi --public --description "📡 Comprehensive research on WiFi-based indoor positioning with ESP32 and Home Assistant integration. Achieving sub-meter accuracy at 90% cost savings vs commercial systems."

# Add remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/jedarden/whofi.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Alternative: Manual GitHub Creation
