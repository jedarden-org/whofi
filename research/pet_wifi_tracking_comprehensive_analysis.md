## 1. Signal Physics for Pet Detection

### 1.1 Radar Cross Section Analysis

**Human vs Pet Comparison:**
- **Adult Human** (150-200 lbs, 5-6 feet tall):
  - RCS: 0.5-2.0 m² (depending on orientation)
  - Signal reflection: Strong, predictable patterns
  - Multipath characteristics: Significant, directional
  
- **Medium Pet** (20-50 lbs, 1-2 feet tall):
  - RCS: 0.05-0.2 m² (4-10x smaller than humans)
  - Signal reflection: Weak, variable patterns
  - Multipath characteristics: Minimal, omnidirectional

- **Small Pet** (10-20 lbs, 8-15 inches tall):
  - RCS: 0.02-0.08 m² (10-25x smaller than humans)
  - Signal reflection: Very weak, inconsistent
  - Multipath characteristics: Negligible

### 1.2 Signal Attenuation Differences

**WiFi Signal Impact Analysis:**

| **Factor** | **Human (150+ lbs)** | **Large Pet (30-50 lbs)** | **Small Pet (10-20 lbs)** |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Signal Blocking** | 15-25 dB attenuation | 5-10 dB attenuation | 2-5 dB attenuation |
| **Phase Shift** | 30-180° detectable | 10-45° detectable | 5-20° often noise-level |
| **Amplitude Change** | 20-40% variation | 5-15% variation | 2-8% variation |
| **Doppler Effect** | Clear signatures | Moderate signatures | Minimal signatures |

### 1.3 Height Impact on Signal Paths

**Critical Finding:** Pet height (1-3 feet) vs human height (5-6 feet) creates fundamentally different signal propagation patterns:

- **Line-of-Sight Paths**: Pets primarily affect ground-level signal paths
- **Reflected Paths**: Minimal ceiling/wall reflection interference from pets
- **Fresnel Zone Impact**: Pets occupy different portions of electromagnetic field patterns
- **Antenna Beam Patterns**: Most WiFi antennas optimized for human-height targets
