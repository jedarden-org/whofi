**URL**: https://eloquentarduino.com/arduino-indoor-positioning/
**Summary**: Beginner-friendly guide that walks through:
- Loading a scanner sketch on Arduino/ESP32
- Training a machine learning model in the cloud
- Deploying the model back to the Arduino board
- Cost-effective implementation (~$3 per ESP32 device)

### 2. WiFi Indoor RTLS Case Study
**URL**: https://eloquentarduino.com/case-study/wifi-indoor-positioning
**Summary**: Real-world case study demonstrating:
- Real-Time Location Systems (RTLS) implementation
- Practical deployment considerations
- Performance metrics and accuracy analysis

## Technical Approach

### Signal Processing
- Uses Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) from multiple WiFi hotspots
- Creates unique "fingerprints" for each room based on visible WiFi networks
- Machine learning models learn to associate signal patterns with specific locations

### Implementation Process
1. **Data Collection**: Scan WiFi networks in each room to create fingerprints
2. **Cloud Training**: Upload data to cloud-based ML training platform
3. **Model Deployment**: Download trained model back to Arduino/ESP32
4. **Real-time Positioning**: Device determines location based on current WiFi signals

### Performance
- Accuracy: Approximately 2 meters
- Cost: Around $3 per ESP32 device
- Deployment: No additional infrastructure required beyond existing WiFi networks

## Technical Benefits
- **Low Cost**: Leverages existing WiFi infrastructure
- **Easy Deployment**: No additional hardware installation required
- **Scalable**: Can be implemented across multiple buildings/floors
- **Open Source**: Complete tutorials and code examples available

## Applications
- Indoor navigation systems
- Asset tracking
- Smart building automation
- Location-based services
