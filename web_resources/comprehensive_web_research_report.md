## 1. WhoFi Technology Overview

### What is WhoFi?
WhoFi is a novel biometric identification system developed by Italian researchers (Danilo Avola, Daniele Pannone, Dario Montagnini, and Emad Emam) from La Sapienza University of Rome. The system uses the way a person's body distorts Wi-Fi signals to re-identify them across different locations.

### Technical Foundation
- **Technology**: Uses Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) to capture unique body interference patterns
- **Accuracy**: Achieves up to 95.5% accuracy using transformer encoding architecture
- **Dataset**: Tested on the public NTU-Fi dataset
- **Operation**: Functions entirely passively without requiring devices or user interaction

### How WhoFi Works
The core insight is that as a Wi-Fi signal propagates through an environment, its waveform is altered by the presence and physical characteristics of objects and people along its path. These alterations are captured in Channel State Information (CSI) containing "rich biometric information". Every human body affects Wi-Fi signals differently based on shape, size, and composition, generating distinctive interference patterns that serve as biometric identifiers.
