# ESP32 Built-in Antenna: Realistic Positioning Accuracy

## Executive Summary

Using standard ESP32 devices with **built-in PCB antennas only**, the realistic positioning accuracy is:

- **Best-case accuracy**: 2.0-2.3 meters (under optimal conditions)
- **Typical accuracy**: 3-5 meters (real-world environments)  
- **Effective range**: 8-20 meters per ESP32 node
- **Application fit**: Room-level detection, not precise positioning

## Built-in Antenna Specifications

### ESP32 PCB Antenna Characteristics
```

## CSI Capabilities with Built-in Antenna

### Single-Antenna CSI Limitations
```cpp
// ESP32 CSI with built-in antenna

```

### CSI Positioning Performance

- **Accuracy**: 2-4 meters in controlled environments
- **Training requirement**: Extensive site-specific calibration needed
- **Stability**: Performance degrades over time without recalibration

## Practical Implementation Examples

### Basic RSSI Triangulation
```arduino
// Simplified ESP32 RSSI positioning
void setup() {
  WiFi.mode(WIFI_STA);
  WiFi.begin("reference_network", "password");
}

void loop() {
  // Collect RSSI from multiple access points
  int n = WiFi.scanNetworks();
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    String ssid = WiFi.SSID(i);
    int32_t rssi = WiFi.RSSI(i);
    
    // Distance estimation (very approximate)
    float distance = pow(10, (-69 - rssi) / 20.0);
    
    // Send to positioning server for triangulation
    sendRSSIData(ssid, rssi, distance);
  }
  delay(1000);
}
```

**Expected accuracy**: 3-5 meters with 4+ reference points

### Enhanced Probe Request Monitoring
```cpp
// ESP32 promiscuous mode for device tracking
void setup() {
  wifi_set_opmode(STATION_MODE);
  wifi_set_promiscuous_rx_cb(promiscuous_callback);
  wifi_promiscuous_enable(1);
}

void promiscuous_callback(uint8_t *buf, uint16_t len) {
  // Parse probe requests and extract RSSI
  if (buf[0] == 0x40) {  // Probe request frame
    int8_t rssi = buf[len-1];
    uint8_t* mac = buf + 10;  // MAC address
    
    // Estimate distance and position
    processDeviceLocation(mac, rssi);
  }
}
```

**Expected accuracy**: 3-8 meters for device tracking

  float environmental_change;
  float final_confidence;
};

Position estimateLocation() {
  Position pos;
  pos.wifi_confidence = calculateWiFiPosition();
  pos.pir_detection = readPIRSensors();
  pos.environmental_change = analyzeBME680Data();
  
  // Weighted combination
  pos.final_confidence = 
    0.6 * pos.wifi_confidence +
    0.3 * pos.pir_detection +
    0.1 * pos.environmental_change;
    
  return pos;
}
```

### 4. Temporal Filtering
```cpp
// Kalman filter for position smoothing
class PositionFilter {
  private:
    float last_position[2];
    float position_variance;
    
  public:
    Position updatePosition(Position raw_measurement) {
      // Predict next position based on movement model
      predictPosition();
      
      // Update with measurement (weighted by confidence)
      updateWithMeasurement(raw_measurement);
      
      // Return filtered position
      return getCurrentPosition();
    }
};
```
