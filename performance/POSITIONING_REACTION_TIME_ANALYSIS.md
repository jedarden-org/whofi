## Latency Optimization Strategies

### 1. Hardware Optimizations

#### ESP32 Configuration
```cpp
// Optimize WiFi performance for positioning
WiFi.setTxPower(WIFI_POWER_19_5dBm);  // Maximum power
WiFi.setScanMethod(WIFI_FAST_SCAN);   // Faster scanning
WiFi.setSortMethod(WIFI_CONNECT_AP_BY_SIGNAL);  // Best signal first

// Reduce processing overhead
esp_wifi_set_ps(WIFI_PS_NONE);  // Disable power saving
```

#### Network Configuration
```yaml
# Optimize MQTT for low latency
mqtt:
  broker: 192.168.1.100  # Local IP
  port: 1883
  keepalive: 15
  discovery: false  # Reduce overhead
  birth_message:
    topic: "whofi/status"
    payload: "online"
    qos: 0  # Fastest delivery
```

### 2. Software Optimizations

#### Real-Time Processing Pipeline
```cpp
class OptimizedPositioning {
private:
    RingBuffer<float> rssi_buffer[4];  // Circular buffer for speed
    KalmanFilter position_filter;
    
public:
    Position calculatePosition() {
        // Process in parallel threads
        auto rssi_data = collectRSSI_Async();  // Non-blocking
        auto predicted = position_filter.predict();  // Predictive
        
        // Fast position update
        return position_filter.update(rssi_data, predicted);
    }
};
```

#### Home Assistant Custom Component
```python
# Custom component for minimal latency
class FastPositioning:
    def __init__(self):
        self.update_interval = 0.5  # 500ms updates
        self.batch_updates = True   # Reduce HA overhead
        
    async def async_update_position(self, position_data):
        # Direct entity update without validation overhead
        self.hass.states.async_set(
            "sensor.person_position", 
            position_data,
            force_update=True  # Skip change detection
        )
```

### 3. Network Optimizations

#### QoS and Traffic Prioritization
```yaml
# Router QoS configuration for positioning traffic
traffic_priorities:
  - protocol: MQTT
    port: 1883
    priority: high
    latency_target: 10ms
  
  - protocol: ESP32_positioning
    bandwidth: 1Mbps_guaranteed
    jitter_control: enabled
```

## Performance Trade-offs

### Accuracy vs Latency
```
Update Rate vs Accuracy:
- 10 Hz (100ms): Lower accuracy, high responsiveness
- 2 Hz (500ms): Balanced accuracy and responsiveness  
- 1 Hz (1000ms): Higher accuracy, slower response
- 0.5 Hz (2000ms): Maximum accuracy, poor responsiveness

Recommended: 2 Hz (500ms) for apartment applications
```

### Power vs Performance
```
Power Optimization Impact on Latency:
- WiFi power saving: +50-200ms delay
- CPU frequency scaling: +20-100ms delay
- Deep sleep modes: +500-5000ms wake-up time
