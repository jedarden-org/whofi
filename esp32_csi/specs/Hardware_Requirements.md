### Antenna Selection Guidelines
```
Application Range    | Antenna Type      | Gain    | Notes
--------------------|-------------------|---------|------------------
0-3 meters         | Internal PCB      | 1-2dBi  | Sufficient for close range
3-10 meters        | External ceramic  | 3-5dBi  | Balanced performance
10-30 meters       | External dipole   | 5-8dBi  | Good range/size ratio
30+ meters         | Directional       | 10-15dBi| Requires aiming
```

### Antenna Placement Considerations
- **Ground Plane**: Minimum 2×2 inches for 2.4GHz
- **Clearance**: Keep 1cm minimum from metal objects
- **Orientation**: Vertical polarization typical for WiFi
- **Cable Loss**: Minimize coax length, use low-loss cable (RG316, RG178)

## Environmental Constraints

### Operating Temperature
- **Commercial**: 0°C to +70°C
- **Industrial**: -40°C to +85°C (select variants)
- **RF Performance**: Degrades above 60°C

### Humidity and Moisture
- **Relative Humidity**: 10-90% non-condensing
- **Protection**: IP54 rating recommended for outdoor use
- **Conformal Coating**: Required for harsh environments

### Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)
- **Shielding**: Metal enclosure with proper grounding
- **Power Supply**: Clean, filtered DC power
- **Layout**: Keep analog/RF sections separate from digital switching

## Hardware Limitations and Workarounds

### Known ESP32 CSI Limitations

#### 1. First Word Invalid Bug
```c
// Hardware limitation affects first 4 bytes of CSI data
if (csi_info->first_word_invalid) {
    // Skip corrupted data
    valid_csi_data = csi_info->buf + 4;
    valid_length = csi_info->len - 4;
}
```

#### 2. Callback Context Restrictions
- CSI callback runs in WiFi task context
- No blocking operations allowed in callback
- Limit processing to data copying and queuing

#### 3. Memory Fragmentation
- Avoid frequent large allocations
- Use static buffers for CSI processing  
- Implement circular buffers for continuous operation

#### 4. Temperature Drift
- RF performance varies with temperature
- Implement calibration routines
- Use temperature compensation in algorithms

### Performance Optimization Strategies

#### Hardware-Level Optimizations
1. **Crystal Oscillator**: Use 40MHz crystal for better frequency accuracy
2. **Power Supply**: Low-noise LDO regulator for clean power
3. **PCB Layout**: Proper ground plane and impedance control
4. **Cooling**: Heat sink or thermal vias for sustained operation

#### Firmware-Level Optimizations
1. **CPU Frequency**: Run at full 240MHz for maximum processing power
2. **Memory Management**: Pre-allocate buffers, avoid malloc in callbacks
3. **Task Priorities**: Set CSI processing task to high priority
4. **Watchdog**: Implement watchdog timer for system reliability
