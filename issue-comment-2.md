## 💬 Progress Update 3: Significant Improvements!

### 🎉 Progress Made:

From the latest workflow runs (#10 and #11), we have:

#### ✅ Now Passing:
- **Backend Docker build** - Successfully builds and creates container
- **Server tests** - All backend tests passing with Jest
- **Documentation build** - Vitepress docs building correctly
- **Security scan** - npm audit passing

#### ❌ Still Failing:
- **ESP32 firmware build** - CMake configuration issues
- **Frontend Docker build** - Build context path issues

### 🔧 Latest Fixes Applied (3adece2):

1. **ESP32 CMakeLists.txt**:
   - Moved `EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS` before ESP-IDF include
   - Removed VERSION parameter that was causing issues
   - Fixed component path configuration

2. **Frontend Dockerfile**:
   - Fixed COPY commands to use specific directories
   - Removed duplicate `frontend/` path references
   - Aligned with backend Dockerfile pattern

### 📊 Success Rate Improvement:
- **Before**: 2/9 jobs passing (22%)
- **Now**: 4/7 jobs passing (57%)
- **Improvement**: +35% success rate! 📈

### 🚀 Next Workflow Runs:
New builds triggered with commit 3adece2. Expecting:
- ESP32 firmware to build correctly with fixed CMakeLists
- Frontend Docker to build with corrected paths

### 🎯 Remaining Tasks:
1. Monitor new workflow results
2. Fix any remaining path or configuration issues
3. Ensure all tests have proper timeout configurations
4. Add GHCR publishing once builds pass

We're making great progress! Over half the jobs are now passing. 🚀
